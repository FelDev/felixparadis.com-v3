I enjoy good advice, motivational content, self-help books and the likes.

Here's a little collection of wisdom nuggets I want to keep. Some of it is paraphrased.

## Action cures fear 
\- David J. Schwartz

## Acrasie
Mathieu Ricard introduced me to this French word.

It means: to know what's best for yourself but not doing it for lack of self-control or willpower.
Some easy examples: smoking, drinking, choosing the unhealthy food, not exercising, not meditating, etc... Aren't we all guilty?

## Motivation is like washing your armpits
> I’ve noticed that people can be quite snobby about books like this. So-called ‘self-help’ books. They can be just as mocking of the people who read them or go to motivational talks.
>
> Their main criticism of the kind of books and talks that motivate and inspire people is that the impact is often fleeting - that the effects of the book or talk don’t last.
>
> My response is to say: of course it is fleeting, of course it is temporary. But so are the effects of washing your armpits - that’s why you should wash them every day!

\- Bear Grylls

## Overnight successes are usually years in the making
\- Tom Clancy, Jeff Bezos and others

## Sleep is like heroin; you'll never feel like you've had enough. Just get up.
\- unknown. (I think I read that as a YouTube comment somewhere 🤔)

## Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.
\- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

I found this quote particularly relevant when doing video editing.

## We are a way for the universe to know itself.
\- Carl Sagan

## You can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.
\- Jim Carrey

## No matter what I do, I ask myself three questions: What do I want? Why do I want it? And how do I get it? 
> [...] know why you're doing it. And know why it must be done. [...] Because when it gets hard, when it gets tough, when your friends walk away from you, when your supporters forget you, when you don't win your first race -- if you don't know why, you can't try again. 

\- Stacey Abrams

## If you have a problem and there is a solution, why worry? If you have a problem and there is no solution... why worry?
\- The Dalaï Lama

<!-- ## Des fois ça en prend beaucoup pour avoir besoin de rien...
\- Maxime Pelletier ..? Kamou 2020-->
